Template literals (Template strings)
Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions. You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with them.
Syntax
`string text`

`string text line 1
 string text line 2`

`string text ${expression} string text`

tag`string text ${expression} string text`
Template literals are enclosed by the backtick (` `) (grave accent) character instead of double or single quotes.

Template literals can contain placeholders. These are indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}). 
The expressions in the placeholders and the text between the backticks (` `) get passed to a function.
